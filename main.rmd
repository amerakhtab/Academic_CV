## **Undergraduate Thesis**  
**Title**: Optimization of DRX power saving for LTE based IoT devices.  
**Supervisor**: Dr. Mohammad T. Kawser   
**Abstract**: One of the key challenges in machine type communication (MTC) is to reduce the energy consumption of the user equipment (UE). In LTE, the key technique to saving power and prolonging battery life is known as discontinuous reception (DRX). The configuration of the extended DRX (eDRX) cycle in Release 13 is a tradeoff between the delay in each session and the paging waste for a user equipment which has a velocity. The objective is to minimize the total battery usage all the while keeping the tradeoff with the delays and the paging wastage minimum as well.
